# tree_with_sizes

It provides an intuitive, hierarchical representation of disk usage, making it easy to analyze folder contents and their respective sizes.

Options:
  directory       The directory to analyze (default: current directory)
  -d max-depth    The maximum depth of subdirectories to display (default: 2)
